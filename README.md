# Protein Machine Learning (Protein-ML)

This repository contains step-by-step implementations of ML/DL techniques applied to protein science. The goal is to bridge protein science expertise with computational techniques.

## **Modules**
1. **Protein Data Handling** – Load, analyze, and visualize sequence/structure data.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Convert protein sequences into ML-compatible features.
3. **Classical ML for Protein Classification** – Train models to predict protein function.
4. **Deep Learning for Proteins** – Use CNNs and Transformers for protein sequence analysis.
5. **Protein Structure Prediction** – Predict secondary structures with LSTMs.
6. **Generative Models for Protein Design** – Use VAEs/GANs for sequence generation.

## **Getting Started**
### **Installation**
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udayakts/Protein-ML.git
cd Protein-ML
pip install -r requirements.txt
